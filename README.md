# Phishing NLP Detection Project

A natural language processing (NLP) project designed to detect phishing attempts in text-based communications.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project includes a model for classifying text as either a *phishing* attempt or a *legitimate* message. The system uses a machine learning model trained on text data, which requires a text cleaning/preprocessing step before classification.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The core files relevant to the project are:

* phishing_detector.joblib: The trained machine learning model and its associated *Tf-idf Vectorizer*, saved using joblib.
* phishing_nlp_detection.py (assumed): The main module containing the clean_text function and the logic for model training and prediction.
* tests/test_pipeline.py: Unit tests to ensure the data cleaning function works correctly and that the trained model can be loaded successfully.

## üõ† Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

You will need *Python 3.x* and the following packages:

* joblib
* pytest (for running the tests)
* The necessary libraries for your NLP model (e.g., scikit-learn, numpy, etc.)

### Installation Steps

1.  *Clone the repository:*
    bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]
    

2.  *Install dependencies:*
    bash
    pip install joblib pytest scikit-learn numpy # Add other necessary packages here
    

## ‚úÖ Running Tests

The provided tests verify the core functionality of the data pipeline.

1.  *Ensure the required files are present:*
    * The file phishing_detector.joblib must be in the project root directory.
    * The phishing_nlp_detection.py file with the clean_text function must be available.

2.  *Execute the tests using pytest:*
    bash
    pytest tests/test_pipeline.py
    

### Test Details

| Test Name | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| test_clean_text_basic | Verifies that the clean_text function correctly *removes URLs* while retaining important keywords (like "click"). |
| test_model_saved_and_loadable | Confirms that the necessary artifacts (vectorizer and model) are correctly packaged and can be *loaded* from phishing_detector.joblib. |

## üí° Usage (Example)

```python
import joblib
from phishing_nlp_detection import clean_text

# 1. Load the model and vectorizer
model_artifacts = joblib.load('phishing_detector.joblib')
vectorizer = model_artifacts['vectorizer']
clf_model = model_artifacts['model']

# 2. Preprocess the new text
new_email_text = "Urgent action required! Click here to update your password: [http://malicious.site](http://malicious.site)"
cleaned_text = clean_text(new_email_text)

# 3. Vectorize the text
text_vector = vectorizer.transform([cleaned_text])

# 4. Predict the class
prediction = clf_model.predict(text_vector)
print(f"Prediction (0=Legit, 1=Phishing): {prediction[0]}")
